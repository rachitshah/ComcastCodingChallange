Coding Challenge - Text Wrap Problem

Write a program that takes an input string and prints it as multiple lines of text such that no line of text is greater than 13 characters and words are kept whole.

For example, the first line of the Gettysburg address:

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal

Becomes:

Four score\
and seven\
years ago our\

new nation,\
conceived in\
liberty and\
dedicated to\
the\

are created\
equal
